When installed using the setup program, Quick Access Clipboard should be launched using the shortcut
(icon) created in the "Start" menu or in the "Startup" folder. These shortcuts set the proper
working directory to "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\QuickAccessClipboard" (where the app
config is saved in the quickaccessclipboard.ini file).

The current file is a flag helping Quick Access Clipboard to detect that it has been launched
directly in the app folder under the "C:\Program Files" directory (or the directory you selected
during setup). When this situation is detected, the working directory is automatically set to
the proper folder under AppData and Quick Access Clipboard is launched.
