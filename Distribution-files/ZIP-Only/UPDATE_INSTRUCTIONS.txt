Quick Access Clipboard
======================

UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PORTABLE INSTALLATION

Using the portable installation

1. Download the new version zip file under Portable installation on this site home page.

2. Quit your current version of Quick Access Clipboard: right-click the Quick Access Clipboard icon in the System Tray and choose Exit Quick Access Clipboard. If you don't before executing the next step, QAC will not be updated.

3. Extract the new version zip file content in the folder where your current version is installed, *overwriting* all existing content. Do not worry: this will NOT overwrite your settings in QuickAccessPopup.ini because this file is not part of the ZIP file. All your settings will be preserved.

4. For your information, a text file was added to your folder with, in its name, the version of the installed version (for example: QAC-v1_0_1.txt). You can delete this file as it is not required to run QAC.

5. Restart Quick Access Clipboard by double-clicking the executable (.EXE) file of the new version. Choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version depending on your system: QuickAccessClipboard-32-bit.exe or QuickAccessClipboard-64-bit.exe.

If you enabled this option, the shortcut in your Startup folder will launch the new version when you will restart Windows.
